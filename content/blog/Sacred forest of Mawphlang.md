<b>Monoliths in Meghalaya</b>

Mawphlang is about 25km from Shillong. This village in the East Khasi Hills of Meghalaya draws its name from nearby monolith. The word maw means “stone” and maw phlang means “grassy stone”.

<b>Sacred forests of Mawphlang</b>

The sacred forest in Mawphlang is full of medicinal plants and old trees. No one is allowed to take anything from the forest as it may upset Labasa the forest deity. People who have broken this taboo have suffered illness.
