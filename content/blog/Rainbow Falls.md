About 6km walk from where the road ends at Lumsophie, Nongriat Meghalaya is this beautiful waterfall. On the way there are living root bridges. The best way to actually soak in this beautiful place is to spend a couple of days at Serene homestay by the double decker Root bridge. This gives us some time to explore the many clear water pools and water falls in the area.

The network of pathways here connects about 150 families. The only way to access these is by foot.

Heprit from “By the way” lent us this great map to find the Rainbow falls in Nongriat Meghalaya.
