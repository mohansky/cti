Arunachal Pradesh is a paradise for those who love to travel, for adventure enthusiasts and especially for cyclists. You hardly come across people or see any vehicles as you navigate through the roads that connect some of the most beautiful and remote villages in the easternmost part of India.

In Arunachal Pradesh, almost everywhere you stop is an ideal place to set up a campsite and have a peaceful time. It is that beautiful! One such spot along our route on this multi activity holiday is Glow Lake, nestled among the forests of Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary.

Below are a few pictures from a previous trek to Glow Lake:
