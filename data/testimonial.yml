      Back in Blighty. Excellent flight home with great views over Pakistan, Iran and Turkmenistan. Thank you all for your company over the last 4 weeks. It's not about the bike, but the journey and who you share that experience with. Couldn't have wished for a better group. Thank you to Morris for initiating the trip and inviting me, Erika for the back office organisation.  Vasanth for such superb leadership and faultless execution, but admirably supported by a brilliant team in Saurabh, Baba, Shafi and Shameer. Until next time.... Thank you
