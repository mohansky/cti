      Ever since I first visited the Indian sub-continent, I have been fascinated with the juxtaposition of tradition and modernity, the contrasts of daily life and of Indian history and the Himalayas. Planning travels and seeking out new destinations is like second nature to me.

      Cycling for me meant freedom. There is no better way to spend a day than to head out on my cycle and explore the countryside.

      Cycle Tours India gives me the opportunity to pursue my dreams while working with some of my closest friends. When I’m not planning the next ride into the countryside with CTI, I pursue my other calling as a serious aquarist and help friends and interested folk setup aquariums.
